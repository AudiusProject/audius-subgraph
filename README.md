- [ ] Finish writing all the mapping from events (excluding gov.)
- [ ] Write docs for the team on how to dev locally
- [ ] Write docs for the team on how The Graph works
- [ ] Add way more comments to the code
- [ ] Demo The Graph to the team - ideally on staging or could use the local setup and screenshare
- [ ] Automate the tooling to generate the config (json file w/ addresses)
- [ ] Move the ABIs to be imported from the @audius/libs npm package (instead of manually moving to the abis folder)
- [ ] Figure out the deploy process for staging
- [ ] Figure out the deploy process for prod
- [ ] Write a test suite 
- [ ] Automate tests w/ CI
- [ ] Add CD
